<b><p class="c">KEYBOARD</p></b>
<h4><p align="center"><p class="a2"> A wireless keyboard is a computer keyboard that allows
the user to communicate with computers, tablets, or laptops with the help of radio frequency
infrared. It is common for wireless keyboards available these days to be accompanied by a 
wireless mouse.Wireless keyboards based on infrared technology use light waves to 
transmit signals to other infrared-enabled devices. But, in case of radio frequency technology, 
a wireless keyboard communicates using signals which range from 27 MHz to up to 2.4 GHz.

<b><p class="c">MOUSE</p></b>
<h4><p align="center"> In computing, a mouse is a pointing device that detects two-dimensional 
motion relative to a surface. This motion is typically translated into the motion of a pointer 
on a display, which allows for fine control of a graphical user interface.
Physically, a mouse consists of an object held in one's hand, with one or more buttons. 
Mice often also feature other elements, such as touch surfaces and "wheels", 
which enable additional control and dimensional input

<b><p class="c">HEADPHONES</p></b>
<h4><p align="center"> Headphones (or "head-phones" in the early days of telephony and radio) are a
 pair of small loudspeakers that are designed to be held in place close to a user's ears. They are 
electroacoustic transducers, which convert an electrical signal to a corresponding sound in the user's ear. 
Headphones are designed to allow a single user to listen to an audio source privately, 
in contrast to a loudspeaker, which emits sound into the open air, allowing anyone nearby to listen.

<b><p class="c">SPEAKERS</p></b>
<h4><p align="center">A loudspeaker is an electroacoustic transducer 
a device which converts an electrical audio signal into a corresponding sound. The first primitive 
loudspeakers were invented during the development of telephone systems in the late 1800s, but electronic 
amplification by vacuum tube beginning around 1912 made loudspeakers truly practical. 
By the 1920s they were used in radios, phonographs, public address systems and theatre sound systems for talking motion pictures.
